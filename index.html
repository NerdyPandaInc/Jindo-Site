    <h1>JINDO Token</h1>
    <p><strong>The Loyal Warrior Companion of the Polygon blockchain</strong></p>

    <p>The most famous Jindo dog is <strong>Baekgu</strong>, celebrated for her incredible loyalty and her journey back to her original owner after being sold to a distant home.</p>

    <p>This legendary tale became a national sensation in South Korea and hereâ€™s why:</p>

    <p><strong>The Journey:</strong> Baekgu, originally raised on Jindo Island, was sold to a new owner in Daejeon, roughly 300 km (180 miles) away.</p>

    <p><strong>Return Home:</strong> After seven months, Baekgu escaped and traveled the entire way backâ€”on footâ€”to her original owner, Park Bok-dan, on Jindo Island.</p>

    <p><strong>National Sensation:</strong> Baekgu's journey inspired books, a TV documentary, and a monument in her hometown.</p>

    <p><strong>Loyalty and Love:</strong> Her devotion made Baekgu a living symbol of the Jindo breed's extraordinary bond with their humans.</p>

    <p><strong>Another Baekgu:</strong> In a separate tale, a Jindo by the same name mourned his owner for seven days, refusing food during that time.</p>

    <p>In honor of Baekguâ€™s journey, <strong>180T tokens</strong> were createdâ€”each trillion representing a mile she traveled to find joy again.</p>

    <p>The burn mechanism represents her enduring loyalty, immortalized on the blockchain.</p>
