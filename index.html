    <h1>JINDO Token</h1>
    <p>The Loyal Warrior Companion of the Polygon blockchain</p>
    <p>The most famous Jindo dog is Baekgu, known for her incredible loyalty and journey back to her original owner after being sold to a new home far away. 
    <p>The story of Baekgu, a Jindo dog who traveled 180 miles to return to her first owner after being sold, became a national sensation in South Korea. 
        Here's a more detailed look at why Baekgu is so well-known: </p> 
    <p>The Journey:
Baekgu, originally raised on Jindo Island, was sold to a new owner in Daejeon, about 300 km (180 miles) away.
Return Home:
After seven months, Baekgu escaped and returned to her original owner, Park Bok-dan, on Jindo Island, having traveled the long distance on foot.
National Sensation:
Baekgu's story was widely publicized in South Korea, inspiring books, a TV documentary, and a monument in her hometown.
Loyalty and Love:
Baekgu's unwavering loyalty to her original owner made her a symbol of the Jindo breed's strong bond with their humans.
Other Baekgu:
Another Jindo, also named Baekgu, gained attention for mourning his owner for seven days after the owner's death, refusing food during that time </p>

<p> For this reason 180T tokens was created to represent the distance that Baekgu took, to be happy again</p>
<p> The burn mechanism represents the ever lasting loyalty</p>
